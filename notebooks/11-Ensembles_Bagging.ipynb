    "The primary weakness of **decision trees** is that they don't tend to have the best predictive accuracy. This is partially due to **high variance**, meaning that different splits in the training data can lead to very different trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging** is a general purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a machine learning method, but is particularly useful for decision trees. Bagging is short for **bootstrap aggregation**, meaning the aggregation of bootstrap samples.\n",
